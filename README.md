# PDF to mp3 file converter
A Tkinter app that converts pdf to mp3. <br>
I used [gTTS](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to convert text to mp3 and [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) to extract text from a given pdf file. <br>
Finding a package for extracting text that works and easy to use was hard for me but thank to [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-extract-text-from-pdf-245482a96de7), I finally decided on using pdfplumber.
